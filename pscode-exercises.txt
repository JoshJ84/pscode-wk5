// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(BEGIN

input num 1,num 2

sum = num 1 + num 2

display total

END)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(take Number
remainder=Number%2
if remainder==0;
   print even
else
   print odd)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Write "please enter 5 numbers"Read n1,n2,n3,n4,n5Write "The average is"Set avg to (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5Write avgIf(n1 < n2)Set max to n2ElseSet max to n1If(n3 > max)Set max to n3If(n4 > max)Set max to n4If(n5 > max)Set max to n5Write "The max is"Write maxIf(n1 > n2)Set min to n2ElseSet min to n1If(n3 < min)Set min to n3If(n4 < min)Set min to n4If(n5 < min)Set min to n5Write "The min is"Write min)
